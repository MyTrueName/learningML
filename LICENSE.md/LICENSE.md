Everything in this repository is my work unless specified otherwise.
"My work" refers to things I created myself.
"Work of others" refers to dependencies, libraries, frameworks, sources etc. that were created by someone else, but are used by me.
I will not explicitly write "this is the work of others" everywhere. Assume that all tools/sources that I use or mention are the work of others.

You can use/share my work if you are not making money thanks to it.
You cannot use/share my work for earning money.
If you want to earn money in any way by using my work - contact me.

If you use my work it needs to keep its licence, so you cannot use it in your free project, then give your free project to someone who will be making money.
They still need to contact me.

That is all.
I wish you well.
